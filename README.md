http-status-echoer
==================

.htaccess file to return error to user based on url.

HTTP status codes copied from http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xml with minor modifications
* Added 402 - I am a teapot
* Removed a couple that my Apache at url below did not like

example: stepanyakovlev.net/error/402
